## The Fisher Iris Data Set

### Introduction
Sir Ronald Fisher (1890-1962) was a British statistician and biologist who is best known for his work in the application of statistics to the design of scientific experiments. Following undergraduate study in mathematics at the University of Cambridge, he remained there for postgraduate work in physics, including the theory of errors. He continued his research in statistics over the next few years while working in various jobs - insurance company ststistician and teacher. In 1919 he became the statistician at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in Hertfordshire gaining access t huge amounts of agricultural data. Here, he developed and applied statistical methods to the design of plant breeding experiments in order to get maximum useful information from the experiments while minimizing time, effort, and money. 

#### Description of the data set
Fisher's (or Anderson's) iris data set gives the measurements in centimetres of the variables sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of three species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. The data set consists of 150 rows (50 samples from each species) by five columns. The first four columns are the names of the variables above, the fifth contains the species name.
