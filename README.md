## The Fisher Iris Data Set

### Introduction
Sir Ronald Fisher (1890-1962) was a British statistician and biologist who is best known for his work in the application of statistics to the design of scientific experiments. Following undergraduate study in mathematics at the University of Cambridge, he remained there for postgraduate work in physics, including the theory of errors. He continued his research in statistics over the next few years while working in various jobs - insurance company ststistician and teacher. In 1919 he became the statistician at the Rothamsted Experimental Station in Hertfordshire,where he had access to huge amounts of agricultural data. Here, he developed and applied statistical methods to the design of plant breeding experiments in order to get maximum useful information from the experiments while minimizing time, effort, and money. He held academic positions at University College London and Cambridge University before retiring to Australia, where he died in 1962. During his career he published many articles and books on various topics in statistics and genetics, including the method of maximum likelihood estimation and the analysis of variance.

Fisher introduced the iris flower data set and the idea of linear discriminent analysis (LDA) in a 1936 publication. LDA is a method to reduce the number of dimensions in data in order to perform pattern classification or machine learning. As the MathWorks reference below states, if you have a data set containing observations with measurements on many variables and their known classes, could you use this data to determne which class measurements from new  observations are most likely to belong to? It seems to be a popular data set for demonstrating how to perform classification and for providing training sets in machine learning (see Wolfram reference below).  

#### Description of the data set
Fisher's (or Anderson's) iris data set gives the measurements in centimetres of the variables sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width (in that order) for 50 flowers from each of three species of iris. The species are _Iris setosa_, _Iris versicolor_, and _Iris virginica_. The data set consists of 150 rows or observations (50 samples from each species) by five columns. The first four columns contain the samples/measurements and the fifth contains the species name (or class). I obtained the data set as a csv file from GitHub as detailed below.
